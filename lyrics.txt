Legends Lyrics
[Intro: Lil Baby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Hundred million dollars, that ain't shit (To a hustler)
Pretty shit, I got 'em lockin' lips (Yeah)
Sixty mill' in hundreds like I'm Nipsey

Me and white boys talkin' billies
Nine Trey, brodie them some Billies

Pretty shit, I got her rockin' Audemaurs

Carbon fiber kitted, this a Spider
2025, the Spec' a hybrid
ERD, the leather like a biker

Coupe or Cupra truck, I'm indecisive
Brodie 'nem behind me in the strikers
They gon' handle business, never call me (Frr, frr)
Lawyer adjacent, royalty like Saudi
Free Lil Durk, hit Trump to get him pardoned (Free Smurk)

Nasty shit, she feed me from the garden
Body flawless, look like someone drawed her
I know this shit different, don't record it
Million dollar niggas, I absorb 'em
Soaked up all the game and then I ran with it
Police-ass niggas, they can't hang with us
Safe, but still in style, the Range a bulletproof
Me and twin done had 'em, we identical (Say twin)
Thirty hour flight, we on a island
Grown man business, ho, you childish
Real Atlanta, I'm from Fulton County

No machines, we had to hand count it (Frr)
Two M's for a show, nigga, ragers
Slide my tongue from her neck to her naval
Bro gon' spend on his water, the navy
Needed space, so I bought out the neighbors[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm from the trenches, break bills, not no britches
I hit it, dismiss it, then dab like I'm Quavo (Yeah)
Super hard on a bitch, I don't play, ho
Right beside of me, she wanna lay, ho
Somebody ****, they want beef

I made a million off one street
I'm a legend 'round there, where I come from
Super smart, when it's time, I go dumb-dumb (Dumb)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Come through trim on a bitch, I go too hard (Woo)
From the streets, out the zoo, we in your yard (Zoo)
In my bag, stuffin' blues in the Goyard (Cash)

In the coupe, off the ground like a go-kart
(Skrrt)
This ho don't got a heart, fucked the gizz-ang (Ooh)
She go Coco Chanel, she insi-zane (Coco)
Come and swim with some sharks, this ain't no tank (Splash)
Set up trap by the Benz off the blizz-ane
Louis Vuitton vintage from the '90s (Ah)
Infinity dipped in chrome like I primed it
Your bitch ain't comin' home, gotta find her
Don't check her phone and find out what your wife at (Brr)
Paris Fashion Week, I'm goin' Eiffel
Money tall as Easy Money Sniper

Long live Takeoff, runnin' with the rifle (Sniper)

12 found the strap, I had to bribe 'em
Pulled off doin' the dash, I burned the pavement
Cactus Jack the engine, got it ragin' (Ah
)
I been drippin' sauce, it turned to gravy
Told him, "Knock 'em off, I make you famous"
Bitch, my diamonds dancin', Usher Raymond

Why they wearin' shiestys like they dangerous?
Get defined, search him, he a stranger
How the fuck you be a Twitter gangster?
Pocket full of four rings like I'm Audi
I want my bitches geek with me like Scotty (Geek)

Give me some top, let me bless you about it
I told her act brand new when she get that body (Brand new)
Glock got a box, call it Roddy (Frr)

Quarterback Quavo, the Huncho got options (Woo)

I rep the hood when it's crowded (Gang)
From the concrete like I'm Yachty (Yeah)[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm from the trenches, break bills, not no britches
I hit it, dismiss it, then dab like I'm Quavo (Yeah)
Super hard on a bitch, I don't play, ho
Right beside of me, she wanna lay, ho
Somebody ****, they want beef
I made a million off one street
I'm a legend 'round there, where I come from
Super smart, when it's time, I go dumb-dumb (Dumb)
